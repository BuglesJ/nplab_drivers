## nplab_drivers
Some drivers in development for the Nadj-Perge Group at Caltech.
To be used along with the QCoDes environment, which you can clone:
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes.git

Clone this repository into the instrument_drivers folder where QCoDeS is installed in your working python distribution. Ex: <path_to>/anaconda/lib/Python3.6/site-packages/qcodes/qcodes/instrument_drivers

Right now it just consists of an unfinished Tektronix Keithley 2182a instrument driver.
